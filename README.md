# Cellular automata - Game of Life

Simple experiment of implementing [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in php.

To be fair, I call it cellular automata only, because it sounds cool lmao.

## Usage

```sh
$ php automata.php <file>|<size>
```

When there is size, it will generate random matrix of $size\*size$
