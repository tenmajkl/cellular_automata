# Cellular automata - Game of Life

Simple experiment of implementing [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in php.

To be fair, I call it cellular automata only, because it sounds cool lmao.

## Usage

```sh
$ php automata.php <file>|<size>
```

When there is size, it will generate random matrix of $size\*size$

# 🦠 Cellular Automata - Game of Life 🎮
This is no ordinary PHP experiment, folks. It's a journey into the world of "Game of Life", and boy, does life get wild here!

To be brutally honest, I've slapped on the "cellular automata" tag because, well, it just sounds super space-age and nerdy. Like, who wouldn't want to command a squadron of Starfleet cells, am I right? 😂

## Usage
Think of this as a DIY project where you get to bring your own cells to life. Here's the cheat code:

$ php automata.php <file>|<size>



When you enter the size, it's like hitting the jackpot on a cellular slot machine. You'll get a random matrix popping up faster than popcorn!

## 🐣 Life, uh... Finds a Way!
Remember, folks, this isn't just the "Game of Life". It's more like the "Game of PHP Life", where cells, automata and code come together in a glorious explosion of fun, frustration and "blazingly fast" execution.

So get your code fingers ready, take the plunge, and let's see if your cells have what it takes to win at life! 

Disclaimer: I take no responsibility for any existential crises this game may cause. 😆

Roll the dice, and let the game of life begin! 🚀
